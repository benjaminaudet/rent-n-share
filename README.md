# Rent'n'Share

## A mobile application pedagogical project. It's basically a renting marketplace.

This project is using Phonegap. That allows us to test easily our hybrid application and to build apk from web languages.
As backend solution we use Firebase from google.

### Install the project

```
$ npm install
$ npx webpack
```

### Launch the application

```
$ phonegap serve
```

Use it through your web browser or directly via the application PhoneGap findable on the PlayStore.
